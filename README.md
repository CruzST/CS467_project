# CS467_project
Capstone project for OSU CS467 created by: Steven Cruz, Dominic Nieves, Michelle Tan

## About
For OSU's capstone project, the group decided to work on implementing a POC b2b2c e-commerce site, similar to popular websites such as 
Etsy and Redbubble. As with Etsy, users are able to register as sellers to create their own store, where they will manage their own 
inventory and orders. At the same time, they may act as customers to view stores and products, make orders, and review products. 

The project consists of MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node (MEVN).



## To start run the project locally:

1. Unzip the project.
2. If npm/node.js is not installed on the computer, get it.
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Open the terminal (windows or git bash) Inside the project’s client folder...
4. Run **npm install** (for dependencies)
5. Run **npm run serve**
6. Terminal will indicate where the front end server is running (typically localhost:8081 or localhost:8080)
7. Open the terminal (windows or git bash) Inside the project’s server folder:
8. Run **npm install** (for dependencies)
9. Run **node server.js** or **npm start**
10. Back end server will be running on localhost:3000
